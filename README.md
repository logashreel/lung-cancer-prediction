# Lung Cancer Prediction System

This project is a machine learning–based web application that predicts lung cancer survival
using patient health data.

## Features
- Single-page Streamlit dashboard
- User input for new patient data
- Lung cancer survival prediction
- Patient recommendations
- Downloadable final report

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The original dataset used in this project is large and exceeds GitHub's file size limit.
Hence, it is not uploaded to this repository.

To run the project:
- Place the dataset file in the same folder as `finalcode.py`
- Rename the dataset as `dataset_med.csv`

## How to Run
```bash
streamlit run finalcode.py
